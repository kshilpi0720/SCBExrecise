# SCBExrecise
SCB Project

It is the POC for springboot microservices with following key concepts
  
    1. Autogenerate database
    2. Integrate microservises by using finge client
    3. Control services using Eureka server/cleint architecture
    4. Auto genarate swagger/openAPI docs for springboot version 3 applications
    5. Perform basic CRUD operations using microservices
    6. Use h2 database for data storage
    
    
    
 This is an initial effort to put all my learnings into a working application to showcase the E2E flow.

 @Github users/Viewers - request you to please help me by reviewing this base level effort and provide your feedback.
